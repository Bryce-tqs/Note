## 1. What is a cover letter?

***A cover letter is a document sent alongside your CV when applying for jobs.*** It acts as a personal introduction and helps to sell your application. A cover letter is necessary as it gives you the chance to explain to an employer **why you're the best candidate for the job.** You do this by **highlighting relevant skills and experience**; therefore you should always write your cover letter with the position you're applying for in mind.

Not to be confused with [personal statements for your CV](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/cvs-and-cover-letters/writing-a-personal-statement-for-your-cv), cover letters should **complement** your CV but **not duplicate** it. The general consensus among recruiters when it comes to the length of these documents is the shorter the better. Typically three to five short paragraphs, cover letters should **not exceed one A4 page.**

If sending electronically, put the text in the body of the email rather than as an attachment, to avoid it being detected by spam filters.

Applications should always include a cover letter unless the job advert instructs you differently.

* Compliments CV; Directs readers attention to the most relevant aspects of your CV.
* Introduces yourself as a competitive candidate; Hightlight connections 
* Writing sample; —Demonstrates your ability to communicate in writing and organize your thoughts in a clear manner.
* **Entice** the reader to carefully examine your application.
