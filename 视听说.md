## French cuisine

**French cuisine** ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Cuisine française*) consists of the [cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking) traditions and practices from [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France).

French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by the many surrounding cultures of Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic, the [Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel) and of course, inland.

In the 14th century, [Guillaume Tirel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Tirel), a [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_(royal)) [chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef) known as "Taillevent", wrote *[Le Viandier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Viandier)*, one of the earliest [recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe) collections of [medieval France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_Middle_Ages). In the 17th century, chefs [François Pierre La Varenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François_Pierre_La_Varenne) and [Marie-Antoine Carême](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Antoine_Carême) spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.

* Court chef 宫廷的厨师
* Le Viandier ：a recipe collection

Cheese and [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_wine) are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and *[appellation d'origine contrôlée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d'origine_contrôlée)* (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine#cite_note-1)

[Culinary tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_tourism) and the *[Guide Michelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_Michelin)* helped to acquaint people[*[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions)*] with the *[cuisine bourgeoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_bourgeoise)* of the urban elites[*[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement) – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:French_cuisine#Dubious)*] and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. [Gascon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascony) cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.

Knowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and [culinary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_art). In November 2010, French [gastronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastronomy) was added by the [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) to its lists of the world's ["intangible cultural heritage"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine#cite_note-3)

* bourgeoise 中产阶级的女人
* culinary tourism 美食旅游
* intangible cultural heritage 非物质文化遗产

French cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruits and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.

With the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned *[hypermarché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermarché)*, these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. [Crayfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish_(food)), for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.[[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine#cite_note-23) Moreover, they do not freeze well.



## Table Etiquette 西餐礼仪

* Tableware Is Simple in Chinese Meals Generally speakingiawe don't use much tableware when we have our meal in China. Mainly we have bowl, dishes, chopsticks and spoons, which we don't use very often. In serving western meals, they use so much tableware with different kinds and sizes. Fox example use silverware from the outside moving inward toward the main plate. (Salad fork, knife and soup spoon are further from the main plate than the main course knife, fork and spoon.)
* in western countries everyone has their own plate of food, in China the dishes are placed on the table and everybody shares. So sometime foreigners feel very helpless when the host and hostess put more food in their dishes and bowls and they can do nothing but eat more and more until they are completely full.
* In China if you invite people for meal, the person who invited other people would pay for the meal but it's not the way in Western country.
- In western country people will think you only invited me but it's not your responsibility to pay for me. I can afford it. They won't be happy if you pay for them.
"Splitting the check" is very popular.

# Terminal

* patio 露台
* pager 寻呼机
* dumb 哑的，愚蠢的

​		Victor Navorski, a visitor to New York from Eastern Europe, whose homeland erupts in a fiery coup while he is in the air en route to America, is stranded at Kennedy Airport with a passport from nowhere. He is unauthorized to actually enter the United States and must improvise his days and nights in the terminal's international transit lounge until the war at home is over. As the weeks and months stretch on, Victor finds the compressed universe of the terminal to be a richly complex world of absurdity, generosity, ambition, amusement, status, serendipity and even romance with a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia. But Victor has long worn out his welcome with airport official Frank Dixon, who considers him a bureaucratic glitch, a problem he cannot control but wants desperately to erase.

## My speech

* Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward. 
* We live in a world that is advancing exponentially: new information coming at us from all sides, with media that is so accessible and that has become our daily life. Thus, the problem becomes about how to get out this cycle of simply processing information and get to creating our own paths, our own ideas, our own lives. I think the solution is the age-old idea of simply pausing, and thinking for a moment. It is distancing ourselves from what is going on and just taking a minute. It’s about re-evaluation and stepping back. Sometimes, we don’t need to react to all this right away to get where we want to go, we just need to think about what we already know, and then build upon that.

The speaker (Cynthia Schneider) studies culture and politics - watching how novels, TV shows and cultural engagement around the globe (and especially within the Muslim world) might lead to political change. In the speech, she looks into two international "American Idol-style" shows of merit-based competition. One is the poem writing and reciting competition in the United Arab Emirates, and the other is singing competition in Afghanistan. She displays the surprising effect that reality TV competitions are creating in their societies. 

Aydah Al Jahani, Saudi Arabian poet, is embraced as a hero by women Ea and poets alike not only in the Arab world but further afield because she defied the political and religious leaders of her country, first ly the fact that' she is performing, and second by the poems she writes and recites - poems which strike out against Islamic extremism in the highly popular Abu Dhabi TV show "The Million's Poet" despite pressure from her family and tribe. She has made it to the top five with poerns that speak truth. She performs with her face completely covered - and the effect is powerful and moving even if you don't speak Arabic. Poet of the Millions, also called The Million's Poet, is equivalent to American Idol. It is a reality television show on the United Arab Emirates television network Abu Dhabi TV. The show is a competition for the most talented poets in Arabic poetry with prizes for the top five poets ranging from AED 1 to 5 million (USD $272,294 to $1,361,470). The show, which has been compared to American Idol, is very popular in the Middle East and called one of the most successful Arab television shows ever. The show is funded by the Abu Dhabi Authority of Culture and Heritage in order to revive the poetry of Nabati, Mwal, Shalla and Qalta. Competitors are judged both by the quality of their poetry and by their recitation.



* Are the two shows Americanized?  
* Are women allowed to participate in the competitions in Saudi Arabia?  are allowed
* Do Arabian poets recite famous poems written by other poets for the competition?  their own poets
* Do the Arabian singers perform pop music in the competition?   x. In a traditional/local way
* Are people in these areas big fans of these shows? yes 
* Are these programs exerting a mighty influence on society?  Yes

1. In Afghanistan, people go extraordinary lengths to be able to watch Afghan Star. How do they do it?

* all over the country in public society, volunteers, campaign  for their competitors

1. Why was Lima Sahar not supported by her friends? Who secretly voted for her by SMS?

- · them for democracy, Taliban

1. Who supported and who did not support Aydah Al Jahant in the very beginning? Then later did those who at first did not support her change their mind?

* Family didn't support, her husband support her. 

1. In what way is Ayah Al Jahani's poetry different from those of other contestants?

* Her poetry is about women and life in society. 



- How are these merit-based competitions, with equal access to everyone. with the winner selected via voting by SMS, changing tribal societies, such as Afganistan and the Arab world?  anonymous
  - undermine the 
  - everyone is equal
  - People are connected by new media --SMS
- How are talent shows doing in China? What is your opinion of these "American Idol-format" shows in China?

  * Maria has been longing to be a nun since she was a young girl; yet when she grows up and becomes a nun, she discovers that it is not at all what she expects. Often in trouble and doing the wrong things, Maria is sent into the world to discover life. She works in the house of a retired naval captain, Captain von Trapp, to take care of his seven children. Von Trapp has been widowed for several years and left alone to take care of the children. By being naughty and playing tricks, the children have forced one governess after another to leave. Now it is Maria's turn to try to restore order in the household. She soon learns all that these children need is just a little love to change their attitudes. She teaches them to sing and to find joy in the smallest things. Through her, music is brought back into the von Trapp family.
