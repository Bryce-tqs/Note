# Lecture 1 The fundamental question

* What is translation?
  * translate: to change written or [spoken](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/speak) words into another [language](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/language)
* What are the different types of translation?
  * 意译、直译、衍译（有时候意译和直译难以分开）
* Why do we translate?
* Why does translation matter?
* What makes a competent translator/interpreter?
* What is the role of the translator/interpreter?
  * 一种比较极端的说法：Translator is a traitor？Spokesman？Linguistic mediator？
* What are the key steps of translation for professional translators?
* What are the factors influencing the translation process and product?
* What is TS? What can we look at in TS?



* Source text（ST）——TT
* SL——TL（target language）



## What is tranlation?

* Translation——from Latin *trans-ferre*. ("to carry across")

* Bengail *rupantar* (="change of form") (孟加拉语)

* Arabic *tarjama* (="biography") （阿拉伯语）

* Chinese *翻译*

* Translation consists in reproducing in the receptor language the **closest natural equivalent** of the source language, first in terms of **meaning** and secondly in terms of **style**. (Nida & Taber, 1969)

* Translation is, of course, a **rewriting** of an original text. All rewritings, whatever their intention, reflect a certain ideology and a poetics and as such **manipulate** literature to function in a given society in a given way. (Lefevere, 2004).  (“操纵”派) 

* Translating can thus be regarded as an **intentional**, **intercultural**, **partly verbal communicative** interaction involving a source text. (Nord 2008)         

  * 翻译是intentional，你的意图是什么，翻译的时候可能会做出一些改变，有时候可能没那么忠实于原文

* 翻译是译者将这一种**语言文字**所蕴含的**意思**用另一种**语言文字**表述出来的**文化**活动（王克非，1997）

* Conclusion：

  > Any definition of anythi ng is theory-bound, so there is no such thing as a totally objective definition of "translation" that we can take for granted before we start studying it, as there will never be any definition of translation that will be all-inclusive. (Chesterman and Arrojo 2000)

  * Theory 只是一个perspective



## What are the different types of translation

* Intralingual translation, or 'rewording' - 'an interpretation of verbal signs by means of other signs of the same language'

* Interlingual translation, or 'translation proper' —'an interpretation of verbal signs by means of some other language

*  Intersemiotic translation, or "transmutation' an interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of non-verbal sign systems'.
  (Roman Jakobson 1959/2012)

  

*  (written) translation vs. interpreting

*  literary translation vs. non-literary translation

  > Technical, scientific, legal, judicial, news... 

- Professional translation VS. non-professional/amateur translation

- Human translation vs. machine translation

- Traditional forms of translation vs. new forms of translation 

> (audiovisual translation, game localization)



* Dynamic vs. formal translation (Nida 1964) 

* Communicative vs. semantic translation (Newmark 1988/1991)

* Covert vs. overt translation (House 1977)

* Documentary vs. instrumental translation (Nord 2008)

* Genuine vs. pseudotranslation (Toury 1995)

* 伪翻译？

  > It is texts which have been presented as translations with **no corresponding source texts** in other languages ever having existed - hence no factual "transfer operations' and translation relationships - that go under the name of *pseudo translation*, or *fictitious translations*. (Toury 1995: 40)



## Why do we translate?

* [T]ranslators and translation scholars must **resist the temptation** to over-romanticize their role in society and must instead acknowledge the fact that they participate in very decisive ways in promoting and circulating narratives and discourses of various types - *some promoting peace*, *others fueling conflicts*, subjugating entire populations and providing precisely the kind of *bridging of language gaps* that allow such atrocities to take place. (Baker 2005)



## What makes  a competent translator?

* Translation competence
* Linguistic and textual competence in the SL and the TL
* Competence in research, information acquisition, and processing
* Cultural competence
* Technical competence
* Domain competence



## What are the key steps of translation for professional translators?

* Translation
* Check
* Revision
* Review
* Proofreading
* Final verification and release



## What is the role of the translator/interpreter?

* Bridge 
* Mediator 调解人
* Intermediary 中间人
* Matchmaker 
* Gatekeeper (不要丢掉本国文化)
* Activist 



## What is Translation Studies?

* TS was established as an academic discipline only in the second half of the 20th century.

* TS is concerned with the complex of problems clustered round the phenomenon of "translating" and "translations". (Holmes 1988: 181)

  > Translating倾向于口译，translation倾向于笔译

* The “map”

## What can we look at in TS?

* a texts (written, oral, multi-modal, etc.)
* ST-TT relations (shifts), translation norms
* a translation choices and the sociocultural factors
* a social/literary/political impact
* histories of translation/interpreting
* a agents (incl. institutions) and ideology
* cognitive and material constraints
*  rubrics used in translation certification test markin
* the use of corpora in translation training



# Lecture 2 A Brief History of Translation in China

* A brief history of translation practice in China
* The great translators in history and their translation theories
* The establishment and development of TS（译学）in China

## 1. A brief history of translation practice in China

* As the earliest records show, sporadic translation activities began as early as the 11th century BC (West Zhou).（外事口译）
  《周礼》；象胥，紫蝥夷国務(（no)我秋之国使，学传王之言而谕说焉，以菜
  《礼记》：寄、象、狄鞮、译
* 中国翻译史上四次翻译高潮
  * 东汉至唐宋时期：佛经翻译
  *  明清两代〔明末清初）：科技翻译
  * 鸦片战争至民国时期（近现代）：文学翻译（启蒙翻译）
  * 改革开放至今（当代）：翻译实践和翻译理论蓬勃发展
    (cf.黄友义 2020：翻译事业的三大高潮）

### 1. 东汉至唐（佛经翻译）

* 古代佛经翻译流程：1 译主    2 度语/传言      3 笔受     4 证义
* 佛经翻译思想：文与质
* 玄奘：文质调和
  * 翻译思想：“正名”、“五不翻” —— “译音”理论，为解决前人译经
  * This translation movement had a great influence on Chinese religion, philosophy, and social life. China, for the first time, came into contact with a completely new culture and showed her marvelous ability to absorb exotic cultures. After that, Chinese culture evolved from a pattern that stressed "oneness of heaven and man" to the intuitive cultural trinity of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. (Luo & Lei 2004: 21)
  * 佛经翻译不仅传播了佛教思想，也极大地丰富和发展了中国的语 言：因缘、涅樂、世界 一尘不染、因果报应、随机应变、天花乱坠 （黄友义 2020）



### 2. Translation of Christianity, science, and technology (Late Ming and early Qing)

* Began with the arrival of the Italian missionaries such as Michael Ruggieri 罗明坚(1543 1607) and Matteo Ricci 利玛实 (1552-1610) in late 16th century, and lasted about 200 years.
* The missionaries (with Chinese collaborators) published a total of 300 works in China, of which 120 concerned science and technology.
  * Euclid's Elements＞几何原本(利玛窦述徐光启译)
  * 平行线 parallel lines
  * 三角形triangle
  * 镜/钝角 acute/obtuse angle
  * 直角right angle
  * 对角diagonal angle
* Impact: Western science introduced into China. Unfortunately, their works failed to have a widespread influence on China owing to opposition from the old guard of the time. Thus, China missed a chance to develop into a powerful nation. (Luo & Lei 2004: 21)
* 翻译贡献和影响：
  * 科学翻译的鼻祖，掀开我国明末清初科学翻译高潮的大幕
  * 精晓科学知识，因此产出一流的译作
  * 术语译名沿用至今
  * 点、线直线、面、平面、曲面、直角、垂线、钝角、镜角、界、形、直径、直线形、三边形、四边形、多边形、平行线、对角线、馨折形、相似、外切
* 翻译思想：
  * 翻译目的：译以致用—选译有用之书，以提高我国科学水平有益民生
  * 笔述时不迷信西士口译之词： “重复订政，凡三易稿”
  * 翻译—汇通—超胜： “欲求超胜，必须会通；会通之前，先须翻译”

### 3.  Translation of social sicences and literature 

* Opium War (1840) : China was forced to open up to the imperialist Western powers > Chinese intellectuals realize that China was no longer the central kingdom of the world ->look towards the outside world and learn from the Western countries so as to strengthen their nation “被迫睁开眼睛看世界”

* 严复《天演论》：改变了中国社会对西方思想的引进态度

* 林纾《巴黎茶花女遗事》、《黑奴吁天录》等：动摇了晚清知识分子

* 翻译思想：体现在译文的序、跋等附文中

* 严复

  * 名著：《天演论》、《原富》等
  * 翻译思想：“信达雅”

* 鲁迅：

  * 日本文学译介：《罗生门》、《一个青年的梦》

  * 俄学文学的译介：占鲁迅翻译量的一半。《死魂灵》（原为《死灵魂》？）

  * 翻译策略——“==硬译==”（stiff translation）

    > 硬译，即严格的直译：“我的译作，本不在博读者的爽快”

* 1920s-1930s翻译标准大战

  * 鲁迅 vs. 瞿秋白
  *  鲁迅 vs. 梁实秋

* 梁实秋

  * 1930-1938完成莎士比亚全集翻译
  * 翻译思想：以“存真”为宗旨；强调“信”与“顺”的统一

* 傅雷（1908-1966）

  * 译作代表：《约翰·克里斯朵夫》、《贝多芬传》、《高老头》
  * 翻译思想：“神似”说

* 钱钟书（1910-1998）

  * 主要翻译活动：《毛泽东选集》

* Gladys B. Tayler （戴乃迭）｜杨宪益

* 传统译论：案本->求信->神似->化境



* The establishment and development of TS in China 

  * 1951年，董秋斯提出建立“翻译学”
  * 1987年，首届全国翻译理论研讨会（青岛），谭载喜：“必须建立翻译学”。
  * 2004年，上外建立我国内地高校第一个独立的翻译学学位点
  * 2007年，中国国务院学位委员会批准设置MTI学位

  

* 许渊冲

  * 翻译思想：
    * “三美”：意美、音美、型（形）美
    * “三化”论：深化、等化、浅化（对钱钟书“化境论”对发展）
    * “三似论”：形似、意似、神似
    * 形与意对辩证翻译观

* 赵彦春：上大外国语学院二级教授，当代著名学者，翻译家
  * 翻译《英韵三字经》、《道德经》
  * “翻译”是“易”、“异”，还是“艺”？
  * 关联理论这一框架内，翻译是一个对源语进行阐释的明示——推理的过程，译者要根据交际者的意图和受体的期待进行取舍，而译文的质量就取决于相关因素间的趋同度
  * **翻译的定义：“翻译不是静态的代码转换，而是以关联为准绳，以顺应为手段，以意图为归宿，尽量使译文向原文趋同的动态行为。”**

# Lecture 3 

## 1. The ancient era

### 1. The Septuagint（《七十子希腊文本》）

* The first major translation in the western world-> the 3rd century BC: translation of the Hebrew Bible (old Testament) into Greek. (标志着西方翻译史的开端)
* This translation is known as the "Septuagint" a name that refers to the 70 (or 72）scholars who were commissioned to translate the Hebrew Bible in Alexandria, Egypt. Each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and according to legend all 70 versions proved ==identical==.
* Although this translation and its interpretations of the Hebrew text have been criticized since its inception, the Septuagint has nevertheless served as a standard reference since that time. It is the source of most of the OT quotes in the NT. (Baker and Saldanha 2009: 21)
* The Ten Commandments  十戒 （来自旧约）
  * I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIM ONLY SHALL YOU SERVE.
  * YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN.
  * REMEMBER TO KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH DAY.
  * HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER
  5. YOU SHALL NOT KILL
  * YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.
  * YOU SHALL NOT STEAL
  * YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS.
  * YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'S WIFE
  * YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'S GOODS.
* Q: Do you think it's possible for the 70 versions of translation to be identical? If not, why was it claimed to be so? 

### 2. Livius Andronicus and Odyssia

* Also in the 3rd century BC (240 BC), Livius Andronicus(里维鸟斯-安德罗尼柯 ）, founder of Roman epic poetry and drama, translated Homer's Odyssey into Latin (Odyssia).

* Odyssia was the first major poem in Latin, and the first example of artistic translation. Livius' translation made this fundamental Greek text accessible to Romans, and advanced literary culture in Latin.

* Livius was the first literary figure to give Odysseus his Latin name, Ulysses.

  > Ulysses: 没有标点

### 3. Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC) 马尔库斯-图利乌斯-西塞罗

* Roman orator and politician, the first translation theorist in the West
* De optimo genere oratorum (46 BC)《论优秀的演说家》： introducing his own Greek-Latin translation of speeches of two fourth-centurv Attic orators
* "I did not translate them as an interpreter, but as an orator, keeping the same ideas and the forms, or as one might say, the 'figures' of thought, but in language which conforms to our usage. And in so doing, I did not hold it necessary to render word for word, but I preserved the general style and **force of the language**."
*  "I did not think I ought to count them out to the reader like coins, but to pay them by weight, as it were."

* $\rightarrow\ $**debate between 'word-for-word' (i.e. 'literal') and 'sense-for- sense' (i.e. 'free') translation**
* Motive:
  * "Since there is but only one kind of oratory, we are searching for **what its nature is**. It is the kind that flourished at Athens. The distinction of the Attic orators in their style is well known, but their essential characteristics are unknown." (Cicero 55 BC/2014: 8)

### 4. St. Jerome (347-420) 哲罗姆 and the vulgate（《通俗拉丁文本圣经》）

> 在name前加st.可以被成为“圣人”

* Biblical translator and theologian (born at Stridon an educated in Rome), traditionally regarded as the most learned of the Latin Fathers
* At a time when different and competing versions of the Bible were being produced, Pope Damasus I commissioned Jerome in 383 to translate the whole Bible into Latin, which was completed in 406. Jerome revised and corrected earlier Latin translations of the Greek NT, and translated the OT from the original Hebrew text (rather than the The Septuagint). <u>This version, known as the Vulgate, served for centuries as a reference for translations into numerous languages.</u>
* "Now I not only admit but freely announce that in translating from the Greek except of course in the case of Holy Scripture, where even the syntax contains a mystery render, not word for word, but sense for sense." (395/2014: 25)

* Q : What can we derive from Cicero and St. Jerome's cases? 

  > 共同点：都偏向于意译

  * translators have choices
  * importance of context/text type
  * texts have purposes
  * translations have purposes
  * Cicero and St Jerome have preferences for particular translation choices in particular contexts or for particular text types



## 2. The Middle Ages(5th to 15th century)

### 1. Bible translations:

* Latin was the "==lingua franca==" of the western world throughout the Middle Ages. Controlled by the Catholic Church in Rome, it "had a stranglehold over knowledge and religion until challenged by the **European Humanist movement** of the 14th and 15th centuries" (Munday 2016: 38).
* The "finest" religious translation in the Middle Ages was the first complete translation of the Bible into English: the "Wycliffe's Bible" (1382-84), named after John Wycliffe, the theologian who directed the translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate into Middle English. (two versions: 1 more literal and 2 freer)
* Motive: to translate the Bible into the vernacular, "it helpeth Christian men to study the Gospel in that tongue in which they know best Christ's sentence" hailed as the Morning Star of the Protestant Reformation

### 2. Geoffrey Chaucer and literary translation

* The first "fine" literary translations into English were produced by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century. Chaucer founded an English poetic tradition based on translations or adaptations of literary works in Latin and French, two languages that were more established than English at the time.
* He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of the Middle English vernacular at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were still French and Latin.
* Chaucer's decision to publish only in English contributed powerfully to the establishment of English thereafter as the principal literary language of England.

* "Wycliffe and Chaucer's translations indicate the two areas in which translation activity really took off in the 16th century in Britain: the Bible and classical literature. During the first 10 years of Elizabeth I's reign (1558-68), four times as many translations were produced as in the 50 previous years." (Barnstone 1993: 209, in Baker and Saldanha 2009: 348)



## 3. The Renaissance period(15th to 16th century)

### 1.Background

* Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg (German craftsman and inventor) introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe (China?) $\rightarrow\ $the appearance of cheaper printed books and a quick growth of the number of readers in West European countries$\ \rightarrow\ $increase in translation activity <u>北宋</u>庆历间 （1041年-1048年）中国的毕昇（970年一1051年） 发明的<u>泥活字</u>，标志着活字印刷术的诞生。他是世界上第一个发明人，比德国人<u>约翰内斯·古腾堡</u>的铅活字印刷术早约400年。

* The birth and strengthening of national European states raised the status of national languages and reduced the role of Latin. $\ \rightarrow\ $Translations began to be performed not only from/into classic languages but also from/into new European languages.

* Protestant Reformation: posed a religious and political challenge to the Catholic Church and in particular to papal authority; challenged Latin through the translation of the Bible into vernacular languages 

  $\Rightarrow\ $Translations: 1) Bible 2) classic Greek and Latin works into vernacular language

### 2. Martin Luther 路德 (1483-1546) and the German Bible

* German theologian, translator and a seminal figure in the Reformation.

*  Translated the Bible into the German vernacular (East Central German) during hiding at the Warburg (after being declared an outlaw): New Testament (1522) from Greek; Old Testament (1534) from Hebrew. Then he continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life. $\rightarrow\ $His use of a regional yet socially broad dialect fostered the development of a standard version of the German language.

* The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, such as the Tyndale Bible, **a precursor of the King James Bible.**

  > 对后世的翻译有很大影响

* Translation principle and strategy: returning to the original languages of the Bible; rejecting word-for-word; TC-oriented (TT reader-oriented, using 'pure, clear German' );
  [logizometha gar dikaiousthai pistei anthropon chóris ergón nomou]
  So halten wir nun dafür, daß der Mensch gerecht were ohne des Gesetzes Werke, allein durch den Glauben.°
  [Therefore, we hold that man is justified without the works of the law, only through faith.]

  * "You must ask the mother at home, the children in the street, the ordinary man in the market and look at their mouths, how they speak, and translate that way; then they'll understand and see that you're speaking to them in German." (cited in Munday 2016: 39)

    > 需要到大街上去与人们交流——children in the street, the ordinary man. 要让这些人都能听懂

  * "From that time onwards, the language of the ordinary German speaks clear and strong."  (Monday 2016: 39)

### 3. William Tyndale 廷代尔 (1490-1536) and the English Bible

* English theologian and translator, said to have mastered ten languages, including Hebrew. His extraordinary English Bible (early form of modern English), produced in exile from a protestant perspective, was later used as the basis for the Geneva Bible (1560) and ==King James version== (1611).

  > King James version: 钦定圣经

* Tyndale's Bible was the first English Bible to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts (c.f. Wycliffe's Bible) and first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in printing.

* Tyndale used numerous sources when carrying out his translations of both the New and Old Testaments.

* Motive: to "cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more scripture than the clergy of the day" , many of whom were poorly educated. By this, Tyndale sought to undermine the Catholic Church's grip on both the access to and interpretation of scripture. To Tyndale, a Roman Catholic priesthood was not needed as an intermediary between a person and God. 

* Catholic officials charged that he had purposely mistranslated the ancient texts in order to promote anti- clericalism and heretical views. E.g. "church", "priest" and "charity" $\rightarrow\ $"congregation" "senior" and "love" challenging key doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. 

* Tyndale's translation was banned by the authorities, and Tyndale himself was executed (strangled and burnt) in 1536. But his translation greatly influenced King James Version and thus everyday language.

### 4. French humanist Etienne Dolet 多雷(1509-1546)

* highly symbolic figure in Western translation history 
* He was accused of blasphemy and burnt at the stake in 1546 because he supposedly mistranslated one of the dialogues of Plato:
  * "Since it is certain that death is not at all among the living: and as for the dead, they no longer are: therefore, death touches them even less. And hence death can do nothing to you, for you are not yet ready to die, and when you have died, death will also not be able to do anything, since you will no longer be ==anything at all==.“
* Five translation principles (1540):
  * The translator must perfectly understand the sense and material of the original author, although he should feel free to clarify obscurities.
  * The translator should have a perfect knowledge of both SL and TL, so as not to lessen the majesty of the language. 
  * The translator should avoid word-for-word renderings.
  * The translator should avoid Latinate and unusual forms.
  * The translator should assemble and liaise words eloquently to avoid clumsiness.
* -La maniere de bien traduire d'une langue en l'autre (How to translate well from one language into another)
  $\rightarrow\ $<u>"the first formulation of translation theory"</u> (Baker and Saldanha 2009: 405)

## 4. Literary translation in the 16th century

* The period of the 16th century is characterized throughout Europe as a key moment in the process of the legitimization of vernacular languages as vehicles of culture and knowledge able to perform the same function as Latin, Europe's lingua franca for many centuries. Non-scholarly literature continued to relv heavily on adaptation. Tudor poets and Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid and others, while inventing a new poetic style.

## 5. The 17th to 19th century

* 就起声势而言，这一时期的翻译不如文艺复兴时期浩大，但所译题材不仅涉及古典作品，而且其广度比文艺复兴时期实有过之而无不及。…至于翻译理论的研究，整个西方翻译界则出现了前所末有的黄金时代。（谭载喜
  2009:84)

### 1.English poet and translator John Dryden 德莱顿(1631-1700)

* In the preface to his translation of Ovid's Epistles in 1680, Dryden (1680/1992: 25) reduces all translation to three categories: metaphrase, paraphrase and imitation.

  * **Metaphase**: word by word and line by line, literal translation
  * **Paraphrase**: translation with latitude, where the author is kept in view by the translator, so as never to be lost, but his words are not so strictly followed as his sense
  * **Imitation**: 'forsaking' both words and sense; this corresponds to Abraham Cowley (1618-1667)'s very free translation (Cowley admits he has 'taken, left out and added what I please' to the Odes) and is more or less what today might be understood as adaptation

* **This three-part, or 'triadic', model proposed by Dryden was to exert considerable influence on later writings on translation.**

* Dryden criticizes translators who adopts metaphase, as being a 'verbal copier' (ibid.). '**Tis much like dancing on ropes with fettered legs - a foolish task**.'

  > dancing on ropes with fettered legs: 戴着镣铐跳舞
  >
  > metaphase：“verbal copier” 词对词的翻译
  >
  > 所以Dryden更推崇==paraphrase==

* Similarly, Dryden rejects imitation, where the translator uses the ST 'as a pattern to write as he supposes that author would have done, had he lived in our age and in our country' (ibid.). Imitation, in Dryden's view, allows the translator to become more visible, but does 'the greatest wrong . . . to the memory and reputation of the dead' (ibid.: 20).

### 3. Scottish writer, historian Alexander Fraser Tytler 泰特勒(1747-1813)

* A good translation is that "**in which the merit of the original work is so completely transfused into another language as to be as distinctly apprehended, and as strongly felt, by a native of the country to which that language belongs as it is by those who speak the language of the original work**". (Tyler 1791 Essay on the Principles of Translation in Robinson 2014: 209)

* ==Three 'laws of translation'== in the order of importance: It will follow,

  * That the translation should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original work.

    > 原作的思想完全的转写

  * That the style and manner of writing should be of the same character with that of the original.

    > 与原作的风格和形式相同

  * That the translation should have all the ease of original composition. (ibid).

    > 想原作那样的流畅/晦涩

* Q: Douglas Robinson (2014) describes Tyler's 1791 Essay on the Principles of Translation as "bland, inoffensive, unoriginal, but extremely accessible".  Do you see why?

### 4. German theologian and philosopher FriedrichSchleiermacher (1768-1834) 施莱尔马赫

- Known as the founder of hermeneutics, a Romantic approach to interpretation based not on absolute universal truth but on each individual's inner feeling and intuition.

- Interested in how translation could be a means for improving German literature and culture.

- On the Different Methods of Translating (Ueber die verschiedenen Methoden des Uebersezens, 1813): the major document of Romantic translation theory, and one of the major documents of Western translation theory in general.

  > 阐释学的创始人

- Two kinds of translation: "The interpreter works in the world of commerce, while the translator proper works in the fields of scholarship and art". Translating in the 1st field is "a merely mechanical task that can be performed by anyone with a modest proficiency in both languages, and where, so long as obvious errors are avoided, there is little difference between better and worse renditions". (???)

- Only two paths are open to the "true translator": The translator either (1) ==disturbs the writer as little as possible and moves the reader in his direction== (reader$\rightarrow\ $author), or (2) ==disturbs the reader as little as possible and moves the writer in his direction== (author$\rightarrow\ $reader).

  > （1）尽可能少的去打扰原作者，而将其思想带给读者（以读者为中心）
  >
  > （2）以原作者为中心

- Preference?

* Schleiermacher's preferred strategy is to, to "give the reader, through the translation, the impression he would have received as a German reading the work in the original language" (**move the reader towards the writer**). In this way, the translator, an expert in the TL, can help the less competent but intelligent German reader to appreciate the ST. 
* *"If ever the time should come when our public sphere gives birth on the one hand to a more profound and linguistically accurate conviviality, and on the other to increased space for the speaker's talents, then we may have less need for the translator in the advancement of our language."*
* Q: Which Chinese translator in history does Schleiermacher's "reader to author" approach remind you of?

## 6. The contemporary period: the 20th to 21st century

* 20世纪之所以被人誉为 《翻译时代》，主要是因为这一时期的西方翻译已扩大到各个领域，具有如下五个特点：

# Lecture 4 Contemporary translation theories in the West

* Literal vs. free debate   $\rightarrow$  more systematic analysis

* Prescriptive $\rightarrow$  descriptive

* Meaning and equivalence $\rightarrow$  Shifts and norms, sociocultural factors/impact, agency and power

* 'cultural turn' (Lefevere & Bassnett)

  > 以前的翻译都是语言层面的，现在讲文化层面

* 'sociological turn '



* 科学？

  * 科学佩戴口罩：the ==proper== use of face masks/to wear masks properly
  * 科学调配医疗力量和重要物资：to ==ensure== coordinated deployment of medical resources and key supplies
  * 科学防治：to ==adopt== a science-based approach/ensuring science-based control and treatment
  * 后勤保障要科学到位： to ==ensure sound== logistical support for medical workers

* some examples

  * ST: China sends Latin America ==junk== it wouldn't dare send to the U.S. or Europe, charging as much or more.                    (*Forbes*)

  * TT: 文章称，中国卖给拉美很多==达不到美欧质量标准的商品==，因为成本要高很多。  （*The Paper*）

  * 老虎、苍蝇：

  * sidelined many ==key political rivals==, or "tigers", and punished tens of thousands of lower officials, or "flies" (NYT, 2018/02/06)

    > Rivals: 把反腐说成是打败自己的竞争对手，变成了贬义

* The questions of meaning, equivalence and translatability became a constant theme of translation studies in the 1960s and were tackled by a new 'scientific' approach followed by one of the most important figures in translation studies, the American Eugene Nida(1914-2011).
                                                                                                                              ——Munday (2016: 62)
  * Nida指出翻译是科学，而非艺术

## 1. Nida 1964: formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence 

* Eugene Nida (1914-2011), American linguist, one of the founders of the modern discipline of translation studies.

* Nida's theory of translation developed from his own practical work from the 1940s onwards when he was translating and organizing the translation of the Bible.

* Two major works: Toward a Science of Translating (Nida 1964); The Theory and Practice of Translation (Nida and Taber 1969).

* 'Principles of correspondence', in Venuti (2012: 141-55 is an essay from Toward a Science of Translating.

* 思想：

  * A functional definition of meaning: a word 'acquires' meaning through its context and can produce varying responses according to culture.

  * Different types of translations $\rightarrow$ three basic factors : 

    * (1) the ature of the message (content vs. form), 

    * (2) the purpose or purposes of the author and, by proxy, of the translator, and

      > Proxy: 如出版机构

    * (3) the type of audience. (e.g. E-C translation of Spanish omelet recipe under Brief A and B)

  * Two basic orientations in translating: formal equivalence vs. dynamic equivalence (+intervening grades possible)    (later called functional equivalence)

    > 形式对等和动态对等（功能对等）

  * F-E: focus on ST message

    * ST message=TT message  (form +content)
      E.g. gloss translation (as literal as possible)
      certificate transition for visa center

  * D-E: focus on ==receptor== response（翻译出的TT能否获得receptor的共鸣，接受）

    * 'principle of equivalent effect'
      Relationship between TT message and TT receptor=relationship between ST message and ST receptor
      Goal: seeking 'the closest natural equivalent to the source-language message' E.g. greet one another with a holy kiss  $\rightarrow$ a hearty handshake all around

  * Observed Tendency:

    * Between the two poles of translating  (i.e. between strict formal equivalence and complete dynamic equivalence)  there are a number of intervening grades, representing various acceptable standards of literary translating. During the past fifty years, however, there has been a marked shift of emphasis from the formal to the dynamic dimension.

      > 不要太看重形式，着重于动态纬度，即在不同的场合，对象等不同的目的是进行调整

* E.g. "停课不停学"

  * stop classes no/not stop learning?

    > 这个例子就是追求形式，而不追求功能，导致让人难以理解

  * Translations from last-year students
    - Stop offline teaching with learning going on
    - The suspension of class does not mean the end of learning.
    - Don't let class suspension keep you from learning.
    -  School can be suspended, but study can not.
    - Learning continues while classes suspended.
    - Ensuring learning undisrupted when classes are disrupted
    - Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning
    - Suspend classes with non-stopping teaching and learning

  * Translations in foreign countries

    * Suspending classes without stopping learning

  * 如果作为一个标语(slogan)，而非句子

    * School's out, learning's not!

* Nida's Contributions:
  ST-oriented -> TT reader-oriented (receptor-oriented) （从作者走向读者）
  (c.f. Schleiermacher: move the reader towards the writer)

  > c.f.: compare 

- Criticisms:
How is the 'effect' to be measured and on whom? How can a text possibly have the same effect and elicit the same response in two different cultures and times?
The whole question of equivalence inevitably entails subjective judgement from the translator or analyst.



## 2. Newmark (1981): semantic translation and communicative translation

* Peter Newmark(1916-2011): English professor of translation at the University of Surrey. One of the
  main figures in the founding of Translation Studies in the English- speaking world.
* Two major works widely used in translator training: Approaches to Translation (1981) and A Textbook of Translation (1988).
* The success of equivalent effect is 'illusory' and that 'the conflict of loyalties, the gap between emphasis on source and target language, will always remain as the overriding problem in translation theory and practice' (Newmark 1981: 38).
* Newmark suggests narrowing the gap by replacing the old terms with those of 'semantic' and 'communicative' translation.
* ==Communicative== translation attempts to produce on its readers an effect as close as possible to that obtained on the readers of the original.
* ==Semantic== translation attempts to render, as closely as the semantic and syntactic structures of the second language allow, the exact contextual meaning of the original. (Newmark 1981: 39)
* 'In communicative as in semantic translation, provided that equivalent effect is secured, the literal <u>word-for-word translation</u> is not only the best, it is the only valid method of translation.' (Newmark 1981: 39)
* Q: Any contradictions?

> 其含义是，不得以的情况下才进行意译，最对等的翻译就是字对字的翻译？

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h11df4m5l9j21070ozdks.jpg" alt="image-20220407191424266" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Newmark's terms semantic translation and communicative translation have generally received far less discussion than Nida's formal and dynamic equivalence. This may be because, despite Newark's relevant criticisms of equivalent effect, they raise some of the same points concerning the translation process and the importance of the TT reader. (Munday 2016: 73)



## 3. Catford (1965): translation shifts

*  J. C. Catford (1917-2009), Scottish linguist and phonetician. Professor of Linguistics at the University of Michigan since 1964.

* A Linguistic Theory of Translation (1965) :an important attempt to systematically apply advances in linguistics to translation.

* Catford (ibid) follows the Firthian and Hallidayan linguistic model, which analyses language as communication, operating functionally in context and on a range of different levels (e.g. phonology, grammar, lexis, etc.) and ranks (sentence, clause, group, word, morpheme, etc.)

* Distinction between formal correspondence and textual equivalence:

  * **A formal correspondent** is 'any TL category which can be said to occupy, as nearly as possible, the "same" place in the "==economy==" of the TL as the given SL category occupies in the SL' (ibid: 27).

    > Economy: 省事

  * **A textual equivalent** is 'any TL text or portion of text which is observed on a particular occasion . . . to be the equivalent of a given SL text or portion of text' (ibid.).

* Translation shifts: 'departures from formal correspondence in the process of going from the SL to the TL' (ibid: 73).

  * Two kinds of shift: 
    * (1) shift of level and 
    * (2) shift of category.
  * Level shifts: a SL item at one linguistic level has a TL translation equivalent at a different level (phonology, graphology, grammar, lexis). 
  * Category shifts: linguistic changes in translation that occur in terms of **structure, class, unit/rank**, etc.
    * （1）**Structural shifts**: mostly a shift in grammatical structure
      * example：
        * 会议选举产生了新一届的政府。
        * At that session, a new government **was elected**.
    * （2）Class shifts: shifts from one part of speech to another
  * All of the parts are unequal. $\rightarrow$ 并非所有部分都相等。
  * All that gliters is not gold. $\rightarrow$ 发光的不都是金子。

## 4. Venuti(1995):domestication and foreignization

> Demestication: 本土化，foreignization: 异化

* Lawrence Venuti (1953-) is an American translation theorist and translation historian.
* Seminal work: *The Translator's Invisibility*: *A History of Translation*, drawing on Venuti's own experience as a translator of experimental Italian poetry and fiction.
* **Invisibility**: 'the translator's situation and activity in contemporary British and American cultures' (Venuti 2008: 1), typically being produced 1) by the way translators themselves tend to translate 'fluently' into English; 2) by the way the translated texts are typically read in the target culture.
* Domestication and foreignization: **domestication** involves 'an ethnocentric reduction of the foreign text to receiving cultural values', while **foreignization** 'entails choosing a foreign text and developing a translation method along lines which are excluded by dominant cultural values in the target language' (ibid.: 242). (drawing on Schleiermacher)
- Like Schleiermacher, Venti advocates foreignizing practices which seek to
"send the reader abroad' by making the receiving culture aware of the
linguistic and cultural difference inherent in the foreign text, and counter
the unequal and 'violently' domesticating cultural values of the English-
language world.

* 比较鲁迅：
  * 有足够深邃的思想（翻译与传播上的欠缺）

## 5. Gideon Toury (1980)

* Procedure for systematic DTS:
  * (1) **Situate the text within the target culture system**, looking at its significance or acceptability.
  * (2) Undertake a **textual analysis** of the ST and the TT in order to identify relationships between corresponding segments (coupled pairs') in the two texts. This leads to the identification of translation shifts, both 'obligatory' and 'non-obligatory'. 
  * (3) Attempt **generalizations** about the patterns identified in the two texts, which helps to reconstruct the process of translation for this ST-TT pair.
- Additional step: repeating of these phases for other pairs of similar
texts $\rightarrow$ norms $\rightarrow$ laws
* Norms: introduced into literary translation studies by Gideon Toury (1980) to refer to the middle-ground constraints between "rules" and "idiosyncrasies", which result in "regularities of translation behavior within a specific sociocultural situation." (Baker 2004: 163)
* Two major sources for reconstructing translational norms: textual and extratextual. The former should be taken as the primary source while the latter should be used only for reference, because translated texts are the immediate representations of norms whereas normative formulations are "merely by-products of the existence and activity of norms". (Toury 1995: 65)
- Initial norms, preliminary norms and operational norms
* **The initial norm**: choice between adequacy (i.e. adherence to norms of the ST and source culture) and acceptability (i.e. adherence to norms of the TT and target culture)
* **Preliminary norms**: reflected mainly by the translation policy (e.g. choice of ST types or individual STs, choice of source-text authors, etc.) and the directness of translation (whether indirect translation is permitted)
* **Operational norms**: directing the decisions made during the actual act of translation at the micro-level
* Tory's theoretical accounts of translational norms have "supported the most active research programme in translation studies to date" (Baker 2004: 163)

# Lecture 5 Translation Between English and Chinese：a Contrastive Approach

## 1. English vs. Chinese

1. Synthetic-analytic vs. Analytic
2. Rigid vs. Supple
3. Hypotactic vs. Paratactic
4. Complex vs. Simplex
5. Front focus and end focus
6. Static vs. Dynamic
7. Impersonal vs. Personal
8. Substitutive vs. repetitive

* 今天不会下雨吧？
* It isn't going to rain today, is it?
* 【汉语语气助词-＞英语反义疑问句】
* 火车未停，请勿开门。
* Don't open the door until the train stops.
  【增补连接词】

### 2. Rigid vs. Supple刚性语法vs. 柔性语法

* 英语：注重主语 (subiect-prominent)，主谓结构严谨，人称和数保持一致逻辑形式清晰。围绕5大基本句型(SV, SVP, SVO,SVoO. SVOC) 进行扩展、组合、省略、倒装。
* 汉语：注重话题 (topic-prominent)主谓结构松散，主语谓语复杂多样，主语可有可无。以话题结构(topic + comment)为主。七大句型：1）话题句2）主谓句3）关系句4) 紧缩句 5）存现句 6）呼叹句7）祈使句。重语感和变通组句自由度很大
  * 开车，他没有经验。
  * He is inexperienced in driving．【主谓逻辑还原】
  * As for driving, he is inexperienced!【增补虚词】
  * 要继续坚持科学佩戴口罩，养成随身携带口罩的好习惯
  * Residents need to continue to wear masks properly and carry masks with them whenever necessary.
    【补充主语】

### 4. Complex vs. Simplex

* 丛属结构 （subordination）是现代英语最重要的特点之：一。现代英语已经朝着plain English 方向发展，但包孕式的复合句(complex sentence with embedded clauses) 仍很常见．相比与汉语句子而言往往更加繁复。由于英语以主谓核心协调控制全句结构．冗长的句子仍逻辑关系清晰不致流散。
* 汉语常用散句、紧缩句、省略句、流水句、并列句, 以中短句居多。书面语虽有字数较多的长句，但常用标点或虚词把句子切开，结构简单，无盈错之感
  (image?)



### 5. Front focus vs. End focus

* English is characterized by front focus: the most important information is often placed at the initial part of a sentence structure.
* The Chinese language is featured by end focus: the most important information is often placed at the end of a sentence structure.
* 英语：句首封闭，句尾开放。(right-branching)
  右接龙：He is reading a book.
* 汉语：句首开放，句尾收缩。(left-branching)
  左接龙：男孩在读书。



### 6. Static vs. Dynamic

* English has a propensity for the use of nouns more frequently than any other parts of speech, and thus the language tends to be static, while Chinese tends to be dynamic for its frequent use of verbs.
* English is featured by nominalization, i.e. the use of nouns to describe actions, behaviors, change, state, quality or emotion which were originally conveyed by verbs or adjectives
* The use of prefix and suffix is partly responsible for abstract diction in English.
  ->English is more static (and abstract) , while Chinese is more dynamic (and concrete).



### 7. Impersonal vs. Personal

### 8. Substitutive vs. repetitive

* 近朱者赤，近墨者黑
* Association with the good can only produce good, with the wicked evil. [重复之省略】

* 一次性用品 disposable goods/Disposables
* 剜肉补疮 rob Peter to pay Paul/resort to a remedy worse than the ailment
  * cut flesh to patch an ulcerate; take short-term measures to do something which requires long-term measures to be taken; to pull through a light crisis or solve a problem at the expenses of the future
  * 两个层面的翻译：字面翻译，解释意思
  * 翻译方法：音译、意译、半音半意译、阐释性翻译、翻译加注释等等。
* 戏说男人

* Chant
  * 咏叹调？
  * 号子
* beasts of the fields
  * 田野里的野兽？
  * 耕牛
* split bamboo
  * 劈开的竹子
  * 扁担

## 句子视角

* 句子视角首先表现于主语，其次表现于句子其他部分
* 孩子们认真而执落地掬起一捧沙，仔细地玩赏。
  - Handful of sand are scooped up with care and persistence under childish scrutiny and appreciation.（书面化，呆板，很多都是用名词堆在一起）
* 没有画框，观众更容易看见画面以外的东西
  * A picture without a frame doesn't limit the vision of the viewer.
* 汉语往往在句中改变主语，形成多视角；英语尽量少改主语，维持单一视角。
  * 一阵小风吹过，孩子打了个喷嚏
* 视角表现于句中其他部分时同样体现汉语重“人”而英语重事物，汉语较主观而英语较客观的特点。
  * The docks remained silent and <u>deserted</u> as rust-colored sunlight flooded the area.
  * 码头上悄无声息、<u>不见人影</u>，只有绣色的阳光洒满了大地。
  * Two weeks later, a fifteen-foot fence with angled rows of barbed wire at the top prevented farther <u>unauthorized access</u> to the crane.
  * 两星期以后，在这座起重机周围竖起了一圈尖桩铁丝网，周长15英尺，<u>防止任何人不经许可</u>登上这座起重机。

## 段落视角

* 这个车站很小，且年久失修，要不是两条铁轨，便很难发现掩盖在松林后面的这个小站，但当我们发现它时还是忍不住欢呼起来，因为我们己经迷路了三个小时，而天色正渐渐暗下来。

* When it first emerged into view in the gathering darkness we could not help shouting " Hurrah" and feeling greatly relieved after getting lost for three hours. It is a small. deserted station with two rails, hardly visible behind the pines.

  > 英文中，“we”出现得更早，调整了“我们”在汉语中出现的位置

  * 开头使用预指的it可以引起悬念，适手文章开篇又符合英语习惯。



# 言外之意

* 文内含有而末明示的意义或虽有表述却意在言外的意思。这些情况在译文中往往都应需要明示，否则译文便不能达意。

## 无表诉的言外之意

* 指原文并无字面表述但实际含有的意义，译文中用划线标明。

* ==表原因==
  * a potato price riot
  * <u>由于</u>马铃薯<u>涨</u>价<u>引起</u>的民众暴动
  
* 表目的

  * I thought, well, the lass could use bit of an old shoulder to lean on.

  * 我想，那好吧，让这小妮子靠在我这老头子的肩上<u>宽一下心</u>。

  * 平日读报，看到一篇好的文章时，总有把它剪下来的欲望

  * When I come across a good essay in a newspaper, I am often inclined to cut and <u>keep it</u>.

    > 把剪下来的目的翻译出来

* 表条件

  * The fellow shifted his feet wearily，

  * 那人一只脚支撑，有点累了就换成另只脚。

  * 她总是把伞挂在门边的把手上……
  * <u>Whenever she carried an umbrella</u>, she habitually hung it on the handrail near the bus door.

    > 把条件翻译出来

* 表背景

  * 如果背景在译文中难以处理但又必须告诉读者，这是便只好加注

* 表后果

  * 而我……就像是一个顽童突然看到了他顽劣的后果

  * <u>I was awe-struck</u> like a mischievous boy brought face to face with the damage he had done.

    > 把后果表示出来

## 有表述的言外之意

* 单词本身
  * 就单词来说，E-C和C-E稍有不同，前者是英语词本身含有的意义，与上下文关系较少;后者则与上下文有关，脱离该文语境则不具有此种内涵。
  * E-C (30-1) In looking over them, and beholding the endless <u>flocks</u> and herds, one wonders what can become of all the meat!
  * 眺望这草场牛羊，心想这么多牛肉羊肉如何处置，不免产生好奇。——flocks指“羊群，herds指“牛群”
    ，meat 自然是这两种牲畜的“肉”
* 上下文隐含的意外之意
  * 有些词主要是上下文赋予意外之意
  * Leaders should provide <u>answers</u> as well as <u>direction</u> in such matters
  * 对这些事，领导者不仅要给予方向性指导，也对问题和要求给子具体解答.
* 特殊的表述方式
  * 无论是英语还是汉语都有些特殊的表述方式完全无法从字面求解，这就要求译者仔细推敲，从语言特点和上下文中求解，然后不拘宇面译出，如：
    * CE（25-3）真正<u>成为自己</u>不是件容易的事。
    * It is not easy to be true to oneself and show what one really is.
    * I wish more than anything else to feel like part of something <u>larger than myself</u> and my personal ambitions, part of a larger culture.
    * 我最大的希望莫过于能感到自己的天地更广阔些，不仅局限于我个人和个人的理想，而要成为范围更大的文化的一部分



# 分合

* 词义 分合

  * 词义分合与其搭配有关，E-C与C-E情况不一样。
  * 分”：虽都是一分为二，E-C是词义增加成为一词二译，C-E却是词义减少只译一半一花看EC“分”一词二译而的情况：
    - E-C (26-1) a very <u>self-possessed</u> young lady of fifteen
    - 一位<u>神情自若十分沉着</u>的十五岁小姑娘”——译文用两个意义互补的词译原文一个词。
    - They are open to new <u>ideas</u>, but they explore their <u>ramifications</u> thoroughly.
    - 它们愿意接受新的<u>设想</u>或<u>建议</u>，但对它们的<u>细节</u>和<u>后果</u>要做认真的探讨
    - 流逝的风，流逝的梦

  * 英语可以搭配的汉语却不行，因而一词二译或数译

    * offered incense, jade and silk, broth and rice spirit

    * “<u>进</u>香，<u>献</u>玉帛，<u>呈上</u>羹汤米酒”

      > 同一个英文单词翻译成不同的汉语

* 句内概念的分合

  * 译文句内概念的排列组合不一定要与原文一致，译文可按自身需要而做一定的变动

  * 先谈E-C的情况，英语叙述较直按，译成汉语==有时加入间接成分，先一般后具体或是先总述后分述==，形成一种分译的情况，如：

    * E-C (12-1) the only people I had ever known…..were <u>the mothers and the daughters</u>

    * 我认识的人……都是一些女性，要么是母亲，要么是女儿

      > 把mother and daughter合起来翻译

    * They were attended from morning to night by <u>female helpers, wives and nurses and secretaries</u>

    * 这些男人从早到晚都有女人侍候，除了妻子还有助手、秘书和护士。

      > 先把共性翻译出来，再分开

  * 一词二译

    * I almost <u>get a creepy feeling</u>..
    * 我有时会<u>感到悚然</u>，身上<u>起鸡皮疙瘩</u>
    * don't they look as if they were <u>muddy up to the eyes</u>
    * “他们那样子真是<u>一身泥士，满面风尘</u>。

  * 英语还常把两件事合在一起讲，译成汉语必须分开，如：
    - E-C (28-2) The beetle and the bee <u>are busy</u> at the grassroot and the blossom
    - 甲虫<u>奔忙于</u>草根，蜜蜂<u>飞逐于</u>花从

* 句间分合

  * 主要指相邻的两句中，一句的某一成分译时并入另一句，先谈E-C的情况：
    - Benjamin Disraeli, who became Lord Beaconsfield，was, in his youth, poor and <u>struggling and passionatelv ambitious</u>. He married a rich widow, much older than himself, and considered by the world to be rather silly.
    - <u>他努力奋斗，雄心勃勃</u>
  * 进行分译，维持并列
    * 鬓似飞云，面如粉黛，青春健美，秀目顾盼……
    * her eyes animatedly expressive, her face as fair as a flowering lily, her hair curling like clouds, and her figure graceful and sappy ． 虽然并列，但语序已重排。
  * 合译：
    * “此花开，彼花谢；彼花开，此花谢”
    * When that flower fades away this comes out.——原文是对照递进，但却是概念重复，因此既可合译又可减译。

* 有分有合

  * 有时不能单纯的分译，也不能单纯的合译

  * A leader who has respect for other people at all levels of an organization, for the work they do, and for their abilities, aspirations and needs, will find that respect is returned.

  * 领导者对本组织各级人员表示==尊重==，对他们的工作、能力、愿望与要求表示==关怀==，他就会发现人家也==尊重他关怀他==

    > 把原文的respect译为尊重，关怀



# 衔接

* 句意间语意衔接
  * It has, therefore, a moral as well as a material existence, and its character and influence are in the main determined by the balance of these two forces. It may make profit or power its first object, or it may conceive itself as fulfilling a higher and more exacting function.
  * 因此，它的存在不仅是物质的，也是精神的；它的性格与影响力主要决定于这两种力量的平衡。它可能以利润或力量作为它的第一目标，也可能认为自己在履行一项更高的、要求更严的职能
* 结尾的承前作用
* 省略
  * 英文省略而汉语重复的例子：
  * And she was thankful to Providence, to her landlady, to her employer, who sweated his workers, to the baker for bringing her loaf..
  * “她<u>感谢</u>上帝；<u>感谢</u>房东太太：<u>感谢</u>她的老板，这个老板可是压榨工人的；她也<u>感谢</u>带给她面包的面包房主.….
