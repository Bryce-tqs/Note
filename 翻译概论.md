  * translate: to change written or [spoken](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/speak) words into another [language](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/language)
* What are the different types of translation?
  * 意译、直译、衍译（有时候意译和直译难以分开）
* Why do we translate?
* Why does translation matter?
* What makes a competent translator/interpreter?
* What is the role of the translator/interpreter?
  * 一种比较极端的说法：Translator is a traitor？Spokesman？Linguistic mediator？
* What are the key steps of translation for professional translators?
* What are the factors influencing the translation process and product?
* What is TS? What can we look at in TS?



* Source text（ST）——TT
* SL——TL（target language）



## What is tranlation?

* Translation——from Latin *trans-ferre*. ("to carry across")

* Bengail *rupantar* (="change of form") (孟加拉语)

* Arabic *tarjama* (="biography") （阿拉伯语）

* Chinese *翻译*

* Translation consists in reproducing in the receptor language the **closest natural equivalent** of the source language, first in terms of **meaning** and secondly in terms of **style**. (Nida & Taber, 1969)

* Translation is, of course, a **rewriting** of an original text. All rewritings, whatever their intention, reflect a certain ideology and a poetics and as such **manipulate** literature to function in a given society in a given way. (Lefevere, 2004).  (“操纵”派) 

* Translating can thus be regarded as an **intentional**, **intercultural**, **partly verbal communicative** interaction involving a source text. (Nord 2008)         

  * 翻译是intentional，你的意图是什么，翻译的时候可能会做出一些改变，有时候可能没那么忠实于原文

* 翻译是译者将这一种**语言文字**所蕴含的**意思**用另一种**语言文字**表述出来的**文化**活动（王克非，1997）

* Conclusion：

  > Any definition of anythi ng is theory-bound, so there is no such thing as a totally objective definition of "translation" that we can take for granted before we start studying it, as there will never be any definition of translation that will be all-inclusive. (Chesterman and Arrojo 2000)

  * Theory 只是一个perspective



## What are the different types of translation

* Intralingual translation, or 'rewording' - 'an interpretation of verbal signs by means of other signs of the same language'

* Interlingual translation, or 'translation proper' —'an interpretation of verbal signs by means of some other language

*  Intersemiotic translation, or "transmutation' an interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of non-verbal sign systems'.
  (Roman Jakobson 1959/2012)

  

*  (written) translation vs. interpreting

*  literary translation vs. non-literary translation

  > Technical, scientific, legal, judicial, news... 

- Professional translation VS. non-professional/amateur translation

- Human translation vs. machine translation

- Traditional forms of translation vs. new forms of translation 

> (audiovisual translation, game localization)



* Dynamic vs. formal translation (Nida 1964) 

* Communicative vs. semantic translation (Newmark 1988/1991)

* Covert vs. overt translation (House 1977)

* Documentary vs. instrumental translation (Nord 2008)

* Genuine vs. pseudotranslation (Toury 1995)

* 伪翻译？

  > It is texts which have been presented as translations with **no corresponding source texts** in other languages ever having existed - hence no factual "transfer operations' and translation relationships - that go under the name of *pseudo translation*, or *fictitious translations*. (Toury 1995: 40)



## Why do we translate?

* [T]ranslators and translation scholars must **resist the temptation** to over-romanticize their role in society and must instead acknowledge the fact that they participate in very decisive ways in promoting and circulating narratives and discourses of various types - *some promoting peace*, *others fueling conflicts*, subjugating entire populations and providing precisely the kind of *bridging of language gaps* that allow such atrocities to take place. (Baker 2005)



## What makes  a competent translator?

* Translation competence
* Linguistic and textual competence in the SL and the TL
* Competence in research, information acquisition, and processing
* Cultural competence
* Technical competence
* Domain competence



## What are the key steps of translation for professional translators?

* Translation
* Check
* Revision
* Review
* Proofreading
* Final verification and release



## What is the role of the translator/interpreter?

* Bridge 
* Mediator 调解人
* Intermediary 中间人
* Matchmaker 
* Gatekeeper (不要丢掉本国文化)
* Activist 



## What is Translation Studies?

* TS was established as an academic discipline only in the second half of the 20th century.

* TS is concerned with the complex of problems clustered round the phenomenon of "translating" and "translations". (Holmes 1988: 181)

  > Translating倾向于口译，translation倾向于笔译

* The “map”

## What can we look at in TS?

* a texts (written, oral, multi-modal, etc.)
* ST-TT relations (shifts), translation norms
* a translation choices and the sociocultural factors
* a social/literary/political impact
* histories of translation/interpreting
* a agents (incl. institutions) and ideology
* cognitive and material constraints
*  rubrics used in translation certification test markin
* the use of corpora in translation training



# Lecture 2 A Brief History of Translation in China

* A brief history of translation practice in China
* The great translators in history and their translation theories
* The establishment and development of TS（译学）in China

## 1. A brief history of translation practice in China

* As the earliest records show, sporadic translation activities began as early as the 11th century BC (West Zhou).（外事口译）
  《周礼》；象胥，紫蝥夷国務(（no)我秋之国使，学传王之言而谕说焉，以菜
  《礼记》：寄、象、狄鞮、译
* 中国翻译史上四次翻译高潮
  * 东汉至唐宋时期：佛经翻译
  *  明清两代〔明末清初）：科技翻译
  * 鸦片战争至民国时期（近现代）：文学翻译（启蒙翻译）
  * 改革开放至今（当代）：翻译实践和翻译理论蓬勃发展
    (cf.黄友义 2020：翻译事业的三大高潮）

### 1. 东汉至唐（佛经翻译）

* 古代佛经翻译流程：1 译主    2 度语/传言      3 笔受     4 证义
* 佛经翻译思想：文与质
* 玄奘：文质调和
  * 翻译思想：“正名”、“五不翻” —— “译音”理论，为解决前人译经
  * This translation movement had a great influence on Chinese religion, philosophy, and social life. China, for the first time, came into contact with a completely new culture and showed her marvelous ability to absorb exotic cultures. After that, Chinese culture evolved from a pattern that stressed "oneness of heaven and man" to the intuitive cultural trinity of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. (Luo & Lei 2004: 21)
  * 佛经翻译不仅传播了佛教思想，也极大地丰富和发展了中国的语 言：因缘、涅樂、世界 一尘不染、因果报应、随机应变、天花乱坠 （黄友义 2020）



### 2. Translation of Christianity, science, and technology (Late Ming and early Qing)

* Began with the arrival of the Italian missionaries such as Michael Ruggieri 罗明坚(1543 1607) and Matteo Ricci 利玛实 (1552-1610) in late 16th century, and lasted about 200 years.
* The missionaries (with Chinese collaborators) published a total of 300 works in China, of which 120 concerned science and technology.
  * Euclid's Elements＞几何原本(利玛窦述徐光启译)
  * 平行线 parallel lines
  * 三角形triangle
  * 镜/钝角 acute/obtuse angle
  * 直角right angle
  * 对角diagonal angle
* Impact: Western science introduced into China. Unfortunately, their works failed to have a widespread influence on China owing to opposition from the old guard of the time. Thus, China missed a chance to develop into a powerful nation. (Luo & Lei 2004: 21)
* 翻译贡献和影响：
  * 科学翻译的鼻祖，掀开我国明末清初科学翻译高潮的大幕
  * 精晓科学知识，因此产出一流的译作
  * 术语译名沿用至今
  * 点、线直线、面、平面、曲面、直角、垂线、钝角、镜角、界、形、直径、直线形、三边形、四边形、多边形、平行线、对角线、馨折形、相似、外切
* 翻译思想：
  * 翻译目的：译以致用—选译有用之书，以提高我国科学水平有益民生
  * 笔述时不迷信西士口译之词： “重复订政，凡三易稿”
  * 翻译—汇通—超胜： “欲求超胜，必须会通；会通之前，先须翻译”

### 3.  Translation of social sicences and literature 

* Opium War (1840) : China was forced to open up to the imperialist Western powers > Chinese intellectuals realize that China was no longer the central kingdom of the world ->look towards the outside world and learn from the Western countries so as to strengthen their nation “被迫睁开眼睛看世界”

* 严复《天演论》：改变了中国社会对西方思想的引进态度

* 林纾《巴黎茶花女遗事》、《黑奴吁天录》等：动摇了晚清知识分子

* 翻译思想：体现在译文的序、跋等附文中

* 严复

  * 名著：《天演论》、《原富》等
  * 翻译思想：“信达雅”

* 鲁迅：

  * 日本文学译介：《罗生门》、《一个青年的梦》

  * 俄学文学的译介：占鲁迅翻译量的一半。《死魂灵》（原为《死灵魂》？）

  * 翻译策略——“==硬译==”（stiff translation）

    > 硬译，即严格的直译：“我的译作，本不在博读者的爽快”

* 1920s-1930s翻译标准大战

  * 鲁迅 vs. 瞿秋白
  *  鲁迅 vs. 梁实秋

* 梁实秋

  * 1930-1938完成莎士比亚全集翻译
  * 翻译思想：以“存真”为宗旨；强调“信”与“顺”的统一

* 傅雷（1908-1966）

  * 译作代表：《约翰·克里斯朵夫》、《贝多芬传》、《高老头》
  * 翻译思想：“神似”说

* 钱钟书（1910-1998）

  * 主要翻译活动：《毛泽东选集》

* Gladys B. Tayler （戴乃迭）｜杨宪益

* 传统译论：案本->求信->神似->化境
