# Lecture 1 The fundamental question

* What is translation?
  * translate: to change written or [spoken](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/speak) words into another [language](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/language)
* What are the different types of translation?
  * 意译、直译、衍译（有时候意译和直译难以分开）
* Why do we translate?
* Why does translation matter?
* What makes a competent translator/interpreter?
* What is the role of the translator/interpreter?
  * 一种比较极端的说法：Translator is a traitor？Spokesman？Linguistic mediator？
* What are the key steps of translation for professional translators?
* What are the factors influencing the translation process and product?
* What is TS? What can we look at in TS?



* Source text（ST）——TT
* SL——TL（target language）



## What is tranlation?

* Translation——from Latin *trans-ferre*. ("to carry across")

* Bengail *rupantar* (="change of form") (孟加拉语)

* Arabic *tarjama* (="biography") （阿拉伯语）

* Chinese *翻译*

* Translation consists in reproducing in the receptor language the **closest natural equivalent** of the source language, first in terms of **meaning** and secondly in terms of **style**. (Nida & Taber, 1969)

* Translation is, of course, a **rewriting** of an original text. All rewritings, whatever their intention, reflect a certain ideology and a poetics and as such **manipulate** literature to function in a given society in a given way. (Lefevere, 2004).  (“操纵”派) 

* Translating can thus be regarded as an **intentional**, **intercultural**, **partly verbal communicative** interaction involving a source text. (Nord 2008)         

  * 翻译是intentional，你的意图是什么，翻译的时候可能会做出一些改变，有时候可能没那么忠实于原文

* 翻译是译者将这一种**语言文字**所蕴含的**意思**用另一种**语言文字**表述出来的**文化**活动（王克非，1997）

* Conclusion：

  > Any definition of anythi ng is theory-bound, so there is no such thing as a totally objective definition of "translation" that we can take for granted before we start studying it, as there will never be any definition of translation that will be all-inclusive. (Chesterman and Arrojo 2000)

  * Theory 只是一个perspective



## What are the different types of translation

* Intralingual translation, or 'rewording' - 'an interpretation of verbal signs by means of other signs of the same language'

* Interlingual translation, or 'translation proper' —'an interpretation of verbal signs by means of some other language

*  Intersemiotic translation, or "transmutation' an interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of non-verbal sign systems'.
  (Roman Jakobson 1959/2012)

  

*  (written) translation vs. interpreting

*  literary translation vs. non-literary translation

  > Technical, scientific, legal, judicial, news... 

- Professional translation VS. non-professional/amateur translation

- Human translation vs. machine translation

- Traditional forms of translation vs. new forms of translation 

> (audiovisual translation, game localization)



* Dynamic vs. formal translation (Nida 1964) 

* Communicative vs. semantic translation (Newmark 1988/1991)

* Covert vs. overt translation (House 1977)

* Documentary vs. instrumental translation (Nord 2008)

* Genuine vs. pseudotranslation (Toury 1995)

* 伪翻译？

  > It is texts which have been presented as translations with **no corresponding source texts** in other languages ever having existed - hence no factual "transfer operations' and translation relationships - that go under the name of *pseudo translation*, or *fictitious translations*. (Toury 1995: 40)



## Why do we translate?

* [T]ranslators and translation scholars must **resist the temptation** to over-romanticize their role in society and must instead acknowledge the fact that they participate in very decisive ways in promoting and circulating narratives and discourses of various types - *some promoting peace*, *others fueling conflicts*, subjugating entire populations and providing precisely the kind of *bridging of language gaps* that allow such atrocities to take place. (Baker 2005)



## What makes  a competent translator?

* Translation competence
* Linguistic and textual competence in the SL and the TL
* Competence in research, information acquisition, and processing
* Cultural competence
* Technical competence
* Domain competence



## What are the key steps of translation for professional translators?

* Translation
* Check
* Revision
* Review
* Proofreading
* Final verification and release



## What is the role of the translator/interpreter?

* Bridge 
* Mediator 调解人
* Intermediary 中间人
* Matchmaker 
* Gatekeeper (不要丢掉本国文化)
* Activist 



## What is Translation Studies?

* TS was established as an academic discipline only in the second half of the 20th century.

* TS is concerned with the complex of problems clustered round the phenomenon of "translating" and "translations". (Holmes 1988: 181)

  > Translating倾向于口译，translation倾向于笔译

* The “map”

## What can we look at in TS?

* a texts (written, oral, multi-modal, etc.)
* ST-TT relations (shifts), translation norms
* a translation choices and the sociocultural factors
* a social/literary/political impact
* histories of translation/interpreting
* a agents (incl. institutions) and ideology
* cognitive and material constraints
*  rubrics used in translation certification test markin
* the use of corpora in translation training



# Lecture 2 A Brief History of Translation in China

* A brief history of translation practice in China
* The great translators in history and their translation theories
* The establishment and development of TS（译学）in China

## 1. A brief history of translation practice in China

* As the earliest records show, sporadic translation activities began as early as the 11th century BC (West Zhou).（外事口译）
  《周礼》；象胥，紫蝥夷国務(（no)我秋之国使，学传王之言而谕说焉，以菜
  《礼记》：寄、象、狄鞮、译
* 中国翻译史上四次翻译高潮
  * 东汉至唐宋时期：佛经翻译
  *  明清两代〔明末清初）：科技翻译
  * 鸦片战争至民国时期（近现代）：文学翻译（启蒙翻译）
  * 改革开放至今（当代）：翻译实践和翻译理论蓬勃发展
    (cf.黄友义 2020：翻译事业的三大高潮）

### 1. 东汉至唐（佛经翻译）

* 古代佛经翻译流程：1 译主    2 度语/传言      3 笔受     4 证义
* 佛经翻译思想：文与质
* 玄奘：文质调和
  * 翻译思想：“正名”、“五不翻” —— “译音”理论，为解决前人译经
  * This translation movement had a great influence on Chinese religion, philosophy, and social life. China, for the first time, came into contact with a completely new culture and showed her marvelous ability to absorb exotic cultures. After that, Chinese culture evolved from a pattern that stressed "oneness of heaven and man" to the intuitive cultural trinity of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. (Luo & Lei 2004: 21)
  * 佛经翻译不仅传播了佛教思想，也极大地丰富和发展了中国的语 言：因缘、涅樂、世界 一尘不染、因果报应、随机应变、天花乱坠 （黄友义 2020）



### 2. Translation of Christianity, science, and technology (Late Ming and early Qing)

* Began with the arrival of the Italian missionaries such as Michael Ruggieri 罗明坚(1543 1607) and Matteo Ricci 利玛实 (1552-1610) in late 16th century, and lasted about 200 years.
* The missionaries (with Chinese collaborators) published a total of 300 works in China, of which 120 concerned science and technology.
  * Euclid's Elements＞几何原本(利玛窦述徐光启译)
  * 平行线 parallel lines
  * 三角形triangle
  * 镜/钝角 acute/obtuse angle
  * 直角right angle
  * 对角diagonal angle
* Impact: Western science introduced into China. Unfortunately, their works failed to have a widespread influence on China owing to opposition from the old guard of the time. Thus, China missed a chance to develop into a powerful nation. (Luo & Lei 2004: 21)
* 翻译贡献和影响：
  * 科学翻译的鼻祖，掀开我国明末清初科学翻译高潮的大幕
  * 精晓科学知识，因此产出一流的译作
  * 术语译名沿用至今
  * 点、线直线、面、平面、曲面、直角、垂线、钝角、镜角、界、形、直径、直线形、三边形、四边形、多边形、平行线、对角线、馨折形、相似、外切
* 翻译思想：
  * 翻译目的：译以致用—选译有用之书，以提高我国科学水平有益民生
  * 笔述时不迷信西士口译之词： “重复订政，凡三易稿”
  * 翻译—汇通—超胜： “欲求超胜，必须会通；会通之前，先须翻译”

### 3.  Translation of social sicences and literature 

* Opium War (1840) : China was forced to open up to the imperialist Western powers > Chinese intellectuals realize that China was no longer the central kingdom of the world ->look towards the outside world and learn from the Western countries so as to strengthen their nation “被迫睁开眼睛看世界”

* 严复《天演论》：改变了中国社会对西方思想的引进态度

* 林纾《巴黎茶花女遗事》、《黑奴吁天录》等：动摇了晚清知识分子

* 翻译思想：体现在译文的序、跋等附文中

* 严复

  * 名著：《天演论》、《原富》等
  * 翻译思想：“信达雅”

* 鲁迅：

  * 日本文学译介：《罗生门》、《一个青年的梦》

  * 俄学文学的译介：占鲁迅翻译量的一半。《死魂灵》（原为《死灵魂》？）

  * 翻译策略——“==硬译==”（stiff translation）

    > 硬译，即严格的直译：“我的译作，本不在博读者的爽快”

* 1920s-1930s翻译标准大战

  * 鲁迅 vs. 瞿秋白
  *  鲁迅 vs. 梁实秋

* 梁实秋

  * 1930-1938完成莎士比亚全集翻译
  * 翻译思想：以“存真”为宗旨；强调“信”与“顺”的统一

* 傅雷（1908-1966）

  * 译作代表：《约翰·克里斯朵夫》、《贝多芬传》、《高老头》
  * 翻译思想：“神似”说

* 钱钟书（1910-1998）

  * 主要翻译活动：《毛泽东选集》

* Gladys B. Tayler （戴乃迭）｜杨宪益

* 传统译论：案本->求信->神似->化境



* The establishment and development of TS in China 

  * 1951年，董秋斯提出建立“翻译学”
  * 1987年，首届全国翻译理论研讨会（青岛），谭载喜：“必须建立翻译学”。
  * 2004年，上外建立我国内地高校第一个独立的翻译学学位点
  * 2007年，中国国务院学位委员会批准设置MTI学位

  

* 许渊冲

  * 翻译思想：
    * “三美”：意美、音美、型（形）美
    * “三化”论：深化、等化、浅化（对钱钟书“化境论”对发展）
    * “三似论”：形似、意似、神似
    * 形与意对辩证翻译观

* 赵彦春：上大外国语学院二级教授，当代著名学者，翻译家
  * 翻译《英韵三字经》、《道德经》
  * “翻译”是“易”、“异”，还是“艺”？
  * 关联理论这一框架内，翻译是一个对源语进行阐释的明示——推理的过程，译者要根据交际者的意图和受体的期待进行取舍，而译文的质量就取决于相关因素间的趋同度
  * **翻译的定义：“翻译不是静态的代码转换，而是以关联为准绳，以顺应为手段，以意图为归宿，尽量使译文向原文趋同的动态行为。”**

# Lecture 3 

## 1. The ancient era

### 1. The Septuagint（《七十子希腊文本》）

* The first major translation in the western world-> the 3rd century BC: translation of the Hebrew Bible (old Testament) into Greek. (标志着西方翻译史的开端)
* This translation is known as the "Septuagint" a name that refers to the 70 (or 72）scholars who were commissioned to translate the Hebrew Bible in Alexandria, Egypt. Each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and according to legend all 70 versions proved ==identical==.
* Although this translation and its interpretations of the Hebrew text have been criticized since its inception, the Septuagint has nevertheless served as a standard reference since that time. It is the source of most of the OT quotes in the NT. (Baker and Saldanha 2009: 21)
* The Ten Commandments  十戒 （来自旧约）
  * I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIM ONLY SHALL YOU SERVE.
  * YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN.
  * REMEMBER TO KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH DAY.
  * HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER
  5. YOU SHALL NOT KILL
  * YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.
  * YOU SHALL NOT STEAL
  * YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS.
  * YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'S WIFE
  * YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'S GOODS.
* Q: Do you think it's possible for the 70 versions of translation to be identical? If not, why was it claimed to be so? 

### 2. Livius Andronicus and Odyssia

* Also in the 3rd century BC (240 BC), Livius Andronicus(里维鸟斯-安德罗尼柯 ）, founder of Roman epic poetry and drama, translated Homer's Odyssey into Latin (Odyssia).

* Odyssia was the first major poem in Latin, and the first example of artistic translation. Livius' translation made this fundamental Greek text accessible to Romans, and advanced literary culture in Latin.

* Livius was the first literary figure to give Odysseus his Latin name, Ulysses.

  > Ulysses: 没有标点

### 3. Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC) 马尔库斯-图利乌斯-西塞罗

* Roman orator and politician, the first translation theorist in the West
* De optimo genere oratorum (46 BC)《论优秀的演说家》： introducing his own Greek-Latin translation of speeches of two fourth-centurv Attic orators
* "I did not translate them as an interpreter, but as an orator, keeping the same ideas and the forms, or as one might say, the 'figures' of thought, but in language which conforms to our usage. And in so doing, I did not hold it necessary to render word for word, but I preserved the general style and **force of the language**."
*  "I did not think I ought to count them out to the reader like coins, but to pay them by weight, as it were."

* $\rightarrow\ $**debate between 'word-for-word' (i.e. 'literal') and 'sense-for- sense' (i.e. 'free') translation**
* Motive:
  * "Since there is but only one kind of oratory, we are searching for **what its nature is**. It is the kind that flourished at Athens. The distinction of the Attic orators in their style is well known, but their essential characteristics are unknown." (Cicero 55 BC/2014: 8)

### 4. St. Jerome (347-420) 哲罗姆 and the vulgate（《通俗拉丁文本圣经》）

> 在name前加st.可以被成为“圣人”

* Biblical translator and theologian (born at Stridon an educated in Rome), traditionally regarded as the most learned of the Latin Fathers
* At a time when different and competing versions of the Bible were being produced, Pope Damasus I commissioned Jerome in 383 to translate the whole Bible into Latin, which was completed in 406. Jerome revised and corrected earlier Latin translations of the Greek NT, and translated the OT from the original Hebrew text (rather than the The Septuagint). <u>This version, known as the Vulgate, served for centuries as a reference for translations into numerous languages.</u>
* "Now I not only admit but freely announce that in translating from the Greek except of course in the case of Holy Scripture, where even the syntax contains a mystery render, not word for word, but sense for sense." (395/2014: 25)

* Q : What can we derive from Cicero and St. Jerome's cases? 

  > 共同点：都偏向于意译

  * translators have choices
  * importance of context/text type
  * texts have purposes
  * translations have purposes
  * Cicero and St Jerome have preferences for particular translation choices in particular contexts or for particular text types



## 2. The Middle Ages(5th to 15th century)

### 1. Bible translations:

* Latin was the "==lingua franca==" of the western world throughout the Middle Ages. Controlled by the Catholic Church in Rome, it "had a stranglehold over knowledge and religion until challenged by the **European Humanist movement** of the 14th and 15th centuries" (Munday 2016: 38).
* The "finest" religious translation in the Middle Ages was the first complete translation of the Bible into English: the "Wycliffe's Bible" (1382-84), named after John Wycliffe, the theologian who directed the translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate into Middle English. (two versions: 1 more literal and 2 freer)
* Motive: to translate the Bible into the vernacular, "it helpeth Christian men to study the Gospel in that tongue in which they know best Christ's sentence" hailed as the Morning Star of the Protestant Reformation

### 2. Geoffrey Chaucer and literary translation

* The first "fine" literary translations into English were produced by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century. Chaucer founded an English poetic tradition based on translations or adaptations of literary works in Latin and French, two languages that were more established than English at the time.
* He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of the Middle English vernacular at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were still French and Latin.
* Chaucer's decision to publish only in English contributed powerfully to the establishment of English thereafter as the principal literary language of England.

* "Wycliffe and Chaucer's translations indicate the two areas in which translation activity really took off in the 16th century in Britain: the Bible and classical literature. During the first 10 years of Elizabeth I's reign (1558-68), four times as many translations were produced as in the 50 previous years." (Barnstone 1993: 209, in Baker and Saldanha 2009: 348)



## 3. The Renaissance period(15th to 16th century)

### 1.Background

* Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg (German craftsman and inventor) introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe (China?) $\rightarrow\ $the appearance of cheaper printed books and a quick growth of the number of readers in West European countries$\ \rightarrow\ $increase in translation activity <u>北宋</u>庆历间 （1041年-1048年）中国的毕昇（970年一1051年） 发明的<u>泥活字</u>，标志着活字印刷术的诞生。他是世界上第一个发明人，比德国人<u>约翰内斯·古腾堡</u>的铅活字印刷术早约400年。

* The birth and strengthening of national European states raised the status of national languages and reduced the role of Latin. $\ \rightarrow\ $Translations began to be performed not only from/into classic languages but also from/into new European languages.

* Protestant Reformation: posed a religious and political challenge to the Catholic Church and in particular to papal authority; challenged Latin through the translation of the Bible into vernacular languages 

  $\Rightarrow\ $Translations: 1) Bible 2) classic Greek and Latin works into vernacular language

### 2. Martin Luther 路德 (1483-1546) and the German Bible

* German theologian, translator and a seminal figure in the Reformation.

*  Translated the Bible into the German vernacular (East Central German) during hiding at the Warburg (after being declared an outlaw): New Testament (1522) from Greek; Old Testament (1534) from Hebrew. Then he continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life. $\rightarrow\ $His use of a regional yet socially broad dialect fostered the development of a standard version of the German language.

* The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, such as the Tyndale Bible, **a precursor of the King James Bible.**

  > 对后世的翻译有很大影响

* Translation principle and strategy: returning to the original languages of the Bible; rejecting word-for-word; TC-oriented (TT reader-oriented, using 'pure, clear German' );
  [logizometha gar dikaiousthai pistei anthropon chóris ergón nomou]
  So halten wir nun dafür, daß der Mensch gerecht were ohne des Gesetzes Werke, allein durch den Glauben.°
  [Therefore, we hold that man is justified without the works of the law, only through faith.]

  * "You must ask the mother at home, the children in the street, the ordinary man in the market and look at their mouths, how they speak, and translate that way; then they'll understand and see that you're speaking to them in German." (cited in Munday 2016: 39)

    > 需要到大街上去与人们交流——children in the street, the ordinary man. 要让这些人都能听懂

  * "From that time onwards, the language of the ordinary German speaks clear and strong."  (Monday 2016: 39)

### 3. William Tyndale 廷代尔 (1490-1536) and the English Bible

* English theologian and translator, said to have mastered ten languages, including Hebrew. His extraordinary English Bible (early form of modern English), produced in exile from a protestant perspective, was later used as the basis for the Geneva Bible (1560) and ==King James version== (1611).

  > King James version: 钦定圣经

* Tyndale's Bible was the first English Bible to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts (c.f. Wycliffe's Bible) and first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in printing.

* Tyndale used numerous sources when carrying out his translations of both the New and Old Testaments.

* Motive: to "cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more scripture than the clergy of the day" , many of whom were poorly educated. By this, Tyndale sought to undermine the Catholic Church's grip on both the access to and interpretation of scripture. To Tyndale, a Roman Catholic priesthood was not needed as an intermediary between a person and God. 

* Catholic officials charged that he had purposely mistranslated the ancient texts in order to promote anti- clericalism and heretical views. E.g. "church", "priest" and "charity" $\rightarrow\ $"congregation" "senior" and "love" challenging key doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. 

* Tyndale's translation was banned by the authorities, and Tyndale himself was executed (strangled and burnt) in 1536. But his translation greatly influenced King James Version and thus everyday language.

### 4. French humanist Etienne Dolet 多雷(1509-1546)

* highly symbolic figure in Western translation history 
* He was accused of blasphemy and burnt at the stake in 1546 because he supposedly mistranslated one of the dialogues of Plato:
  * "Since it is certain that death is not at all among the living: and as for the dead, they no longer are: therefore, death touches them even less. And hence death can do nothing to you, for you are not yet ready to die, and when you have died, death will also not be able to do anything, since you will no longer be ==anything at all==.“
* Five translation principles (1540):
  * The translator must perfectly understand the sense and material of the original author, although he should feel free to clarify obscurities.
  * The translator should have a perfect knowledge of both SL and TL, so as not to lessen the majesty of the language. 
  * The translator should avoid word-for-word renderings.
  * The translator should avoid Latinate and unusual forms.
  * The translator should assemble and liaise words eloquently to avoid clumsiness.
* -La maniere de bien traduire d'une langue en l'autre (How to translate well from one language into another)
  $\rightarrow\ $<u>"the first formulation of translation theory"</u> (Baker and Saldanha 2009: 405)

## 4. Literary translation in the 16th century

* The period of the 16th century is characterized throughout Europe as a key moment in the process of the legitimization of vernacular languages as vehicles of culture and knowledge able to perform the same function as Latin, Europe's lingua franca for many centuries. Non-scholarly literature continued to relv heavily on adaptation. Tudor poets and Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid and others, while inventing a new poetic style.

## 5. The 17th to 19th century

* 就起声势而言，这一时期的翻译不如文艺复兴时期浩大，但所译题材不仅涉及古典作品，而且其广度比文艺复兴时期实有过之而无不及。…至于翻译理论的研究，整个西方翻译界则出现了前所末有的黄金时代。（谭载喜
  2009:84)

### 1.English poet and translator John Dryden 德莱顿(1631-1700)

* In the preface to his translation of Ovid's Epistles in 1680, Dryden (1680/1992: 25) reduces all translation to three categories: metaphrase, paraphrase and imitation.

  * **Metaphase**: word by word and line by line, literal translation
  * **Paraphrase**: translation with latitude, where the author is kept in view by the translator, so as never to be lost, but his words are not so strictly followed as his sense
  * **Imitation**: 'forsaking' both words and sense; this corresponds to Abraham Cowley (1618-1667)'s very free translation (Cowley admits he has 'taken, left out and added what I please' to the Odes) and is more or less what today might be understood as adaptation

* **This three-part, or 'triadic', model proposed by Dryden was to exert considerable influence on later writings on translation.**

* Dryden criticizes translators who adopts metaphase, as being a 'verbal copier' (ibid.). '**Tis much like dancing on ropes with fettered legs - a foolish task**.'

  > dancing on ropes with fettered legs: 戴着镣铐跳舞
  >
  > metaphase：“verbal copier” 词对词的翻译
  >
  > 所以Dryden更推崇==paraphrase==

* Similarly, Dryden rejects imitation, where the translator uses the ST 'as a pattern to write as he supposes that author would have done, had he lived in our age and in our country' (ibid.). Imitation, in Dryden's view, allows the translator to become more visible, but does 'the greatest wrong . . . to the memory and reputation of the dead' (ibid.: 20).

### 3. Scottish writer, historian Alexander Fraser Tytler 泰特勒(1747-1813)

* A good translation is that "**in which the merit of the original work is so completely transfused into another language as to be as distinctly apprehended, and as strongly felt, by a native of the country to which that language belongs as it is by those who speak the language of the original work**". (Tyler 1791 Essay on the Principles of Translation in Robinson 2014: 209)

* ==Three 'laws of translation'== in the order of importance: It will follow,

  * That the translation should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original work.

    > 原作的思想完全的转写

  * That the style and manner of writing should be of the same character with that of the original.

    > 与原作的风格和形式相同

  * That the translation should have all the ease of original composition. (ibid).

    > 想原作那样的流畅/晦涩

* Q: Douglas Robinson (2014) describes Tyler's 1791 Essay on the Principles of Translation as "bland, inoffensive, unoriginal, but extremely accessible".  Do you see why?

### 4. German theologian and philosopher FriedrichSchleiermacher (1768-1834) 施莱尔马赫

- Known as the founder of hermeneutics, a Romantic approach to interpretation based not on absolute universal truth but on each individual's inner feeling and intuition.

- Interested in how translation could be a means for improving German literature and culture.

- On the Different Methods of Translating (Ueber die verschiedenen Methoden des Uebersezens, 1813): the major document of Romantic translation theory, and one of the major documents of Western translation theory in general.

  > 阐释学的创始人

- Two kinds of translation: "The interpreter works in the world of commerce, while the translator proper works in the fields of scholarship and art". Translating in the 1st field is "a merely mechanical task that can be performed by anyone with a modest proficiency in both languages, and where, so long as obvious errors are avoided, there is little difference between better and worse renditions". (???)

- Only two paths are open to the "true translator": The translator either (1) ==disturbs the writer as little as possible and moves the reader in his direction== (reader$\rightarrow\ $author), or (2) ==disturbs the reader as little as possible and moves the writer in his direction== (author$\rightarrow\ $reader).

  > （1）尽可能少的去打扰原作者，而将其思想带给读者（以读者为中心）
  >
  > （2）以原作者为中心

- Preference?

* Schleiermacher's preferred strategy is to, to "give the reader, through the translation, the impression he would have received as a German reading the work in the original language" (**move the reader towards the writer**). In this way, the translator, an expert in the TL, can help the less competent but intelligent German reader to appreciate the ST. 
* *"If ever the time should come when our public sphere gives birth on the one hand to a more profound and linguistically accurate conviviality, and on the other to increased space for the speaker's talents, then we may have less need for the translator in the advancement of our language."*
* Q: Which Chinese translator in history does Schleiermacher's "reader to author" approach remind you of?

## 6. The contemporary period: the 20th to 21st century

* 20世纪之所以被人誉为 《翻译时代》，主要是因为这一时期的西方翻译已扩大到各个领域，具有如下五个特点：

# Lecture 4 Contemporary translation theories in the West

* Literal vs. free debate   $\rightarrow$  more systematic analysis

* Prescriptive $\rightarrow$  descriptive

* Meaning and equivalence $\rightarrow$  Shifts and norms, sociocultural factors/impact, agency and power

* 'cultural turn' (Lefevere & Bassnett)

  > 以前的翻译都是语言层面的，现在讲文化层面

* 'sociological turn '



* 科学？

  * 科学佩戴口罩：the ==proper== use of face masks/to wear masks properly
  * 科学调配医疗力量和重要物资：to ==ensure== coordinated deployment of medical resources and key supplies
  * 科学防治：to ==adopt== a science-based approach/ensuring science-based control and treatment
  * 后勤保障要科学到位： to ==ensure sound== logistical support for medical workers

* some examples

  * ST: China sends Latin America ==junk== it wouldn't dare send to the U.S. or Europe, charging as much or more.                    (*Forbes*)

  * TT: 文章称，中国卖给拉美很多==达不到美欧质量标准的商品==，因为成本要高很多。  （*The Paper*）

  * 老虎、苍蝇：

  * sidelined many ==key political rivals==, or "tigers", and punished tens of thousands of lower officials, or "flies" (NYT, 2018/02/06)

    > Rivals: 把反腐说成是打败自己的竞争对手，变成了贬义

* The questions of meaning, equivalence and translatability became a constant theme of translation studies in the 1960s and were tackled by a new 'scientific' approach followed by one of the most important figures in translation studies, the American Eugene Nida(1914-2011).
                                                                                                                              ——Munday (2016: 62)
  * Nida指出翻译是科学，而非艺术

## 1. Nida 1964: formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence 

* Eugene Nida (1914-2011), American linguist, one of the founders of the modern discipline of translation studies.

* Nida's theory of translation developed from his own practical work from the 1940s onwards when he was translating and organizing the translation of the Bible.

* Two major works: Toward a Science of Translating (Nida 1964); The Theory and Practice of Translation (Nida and Taber 1969).

* 'Principles of correspondence', in Venuti (2012: 141-55 is an essay from Toward a Science of Translating.

* 思想：

  * A functional definition of meaning: a word 'acquires' meaning through its context and can produce varying responses according to culture.

  * Different types of translations $\rightarrow$ three basic factors : 

    * (1) the ature of the message (content vs. form), 

    * (2) the purpose or purposes of the author and, by proxy, of the translator, and

      > Proxy: 如出版机构

    * (3) the type of audience. (e.g. E-C translation of Spanish omelet recipe under Brief A and B)

  * Two basic orientations in translating: formal equivalence vs. dynamic equivalence (+intervening grades possible)    (later called functional equivalence)

    > 形式对等和动态对等（功能对等）

  * F-E: focus on ST message

    * ST message=TT message  (form +content)
      E.g. gloss translation (as literal as possible)
      certificate transition for visa center

  * D-E: focus on ==receptor== response（翻译出的TT能否获得receptor的共鸣，接受）

    * 'principle of equivalent effect'
      Relationship between TT message and TT receptor=relationship between ST message and ST receptor
      Goal: seeking 'the closest natural equivalent to the source-language message' E.g. greet one another with a holy kiss  $\rightarrow$ a hearty handshake all around

  * Observed Tendency:

    * Between the two poles of translating  (i.e. between strict formal equivalence and complete dynamic equivalence)  there are a number of intervening grades, representing various acceptable standards of literary translating. During the past fifty years, however, there has been a marked shift of emphasis from the formal to the dynamic dimension.

      > 不要太看重形式，着重于动态纬度，即在不同的场合，对象等不同的目的是进行调整

* E.g. "停课不停学"

  * stop classes no/not stop learning?

    > 这个例子就是追求形式，而不追求功能，导致让人难以理解

  * Translations from last-year students
    - Stop offline teaching with learning going on
    - The suspension of class does not mean the end of learning.
    - Don't let class suspension keep you from learning.
    -  School can be suspended, but study can not.
    - Learning continues while classes suspended.
    - Ensuring learning undisrupted when classes are disrupted
    - Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning
    - Suspend classes with non-stopping teaching and learning

  * Translations in foreign countries

    * Suspending classes without stopping learning

  * 如果作为一个标语(slogan)，而非句子

    * School's out, learning's not!

* Nida's Contributions:
  ST-oriented -> TT reader-oriented (receptor-oriented) （从作者走向读者）
  (c.f. Schleiermacher: move the reader towards the writer)

  > c.f.: compare 

- Criticisms:
How is the 'effect' to be measured and on whom? How can a text possibly have the same effect and elicit the same response in two different cultures and times?
The whole question of equivalence inevitably entails subjective judgement from the translator or analyst.



## 2. Newmark (1981): semantic translation and communicative translation

* Peter Newmark(1916-2011): English professor of translation at the University of Surrey. One of the
  main figures in the founding of Translation Studies in the English- speaking world.
* Two major works widely used in translator training: Approaches to Translation (1981) and A Textbook of Translation (1988).
* The success of equivalent effect is 'illusory' and that 'the conflict of loyalties, the gap between emphasis on source and target language, will always remain as the overriding problem in translation theory and practice' (Newmark 1981: 38).
* Newmark suggests narrowing the gap by replacing the old terms with those of 'semantic' and 'communicative' translation.
* ==Communicative== translation attempts to produce on its readers an effect as close as possible to that obtained on the readers of the original.
* ==Semantic== translation attempts to render, as closely as the semantic and syntactic structures of the second language allow, the exact contextual meaning of the original. (Newmark 1981: 39)
* 'In communicative as in semantic translation, provided that equivalent effect is secured, the literal <u>word-for-word translation</u> is not only the best, it is the only valid method of translation.' (Newmark 1981: 39)
* Q: Any contradictions?

> 其含义是，不得以的情况下才进行意译，最对等的翻译就是字对字的翻译？

* Newmark's terms semantic translation and communicative translation have generally received far less discussion than Nida's formal and dynamic equivalence. This may be because, despite Newark's relevant criticisms of equivalent effect, they raise some of the same points concerning the translation process and the importance of the TT reader. (Munday 2016: 73)



## 3. Catford (1965): translation shifts

*  J. C. Catford (1917-2009), Scottish linguist and phonetician. Professor of Linguistics at the University of Michigan since 1964.

* A Linguistic Theory of Translation (1965) :an important attempt to systematically apply advances in linguistics to translation.

* Catford (ibid) follows the Firthian and Hallidayan linguistic model, which analyses language as communication, operating functionally in context and on a range of different levels (e.g. phonology, grammar, lexis, etc.) and ranks (sentence, clause, group, word, morpheme, etc.)

* Distinction between formal correspondence and textual equivalence:

  * **A formal correspondent** is 'any TL category which can be said to occupy, as nearly as possible, the "same" place in the "==economy==" of the TL as the given SL category occupies in the SL' (ibid: 27).

    > Economy: 省事

  * **A textual equivalent** is 'any TL text or portion of text which is observed on a particular occasion . . . to be the equivalent of a given SL text or portion of text' (ibid.).

* Translation shifts: 'departures from formal correspondence in the process of going from the SL to the TL' (ibid: 73).

  * Two kinds of shift: 
    * (1) shift of level and 
    * (2) shift of category.
  * Level shifts: a SL item at one linguistic level has a TL translation equivalent at a different level (phonology, graphology, grammar, lexis). 
  * Category shifts: linguistic changes in translation that occur in terms of **structure, class, unit/rank**, etc.
    * （1）**Structural shifts**: mostly a shift in grammatical structure
      * example：
        * 会议选举产生了新一届的政府。
        * At that session, a new government **was elected**.
    * （2）Class shifts: shifts from one part of speech to another
  * All of the parts are unequal. $\rightarrow$ 并非所有部分都相等。
  * All that gliters is not gold. $\rightarrow$ 发光的不都是金子。

## 4. Venuti(1995):domestication and foreignization

> Demestication: 本土化，foreignization: 异化

* Lawrence Venuti (1953-) is an American translation theorist and translation historian.
* Seminal work: *The Translator's Invisibility*: *A History of Translation*, drawing on Venuti's own experience as a translator of experimental Italian poetry and fiction.
* **Invisibility**: 'the translator's situation and activity in contemporary British and American cultures' (Venuti 2008: 1), typically being produced 1) by the way translators themselves tend to translate 'fluently' into English; 2) by the way the translated texts are typically read in the target culture.
* Domestication and foreignization: **domestication** involves 'an ethnocentric reduction of the foreign text to receiving cultural values', while **foreignization** 'entails choosing a foreign text and developing a translation method along lines which are excluded by dominant cultural values in the target language' (ibid.: 242). (drawing on Schleiermacher)
- Like Schleiermacher, Venti advocates foreignizing practices which seek to
"send the reader abroad' by making the receiving culture aware of the
linguistic and cultural difference inherent in the foreign text, and counter
the unequal and 'violently' domesticating cultural values of the English-
language world.

* 比较鲁迅：
  * 有足够深邃的思想（翻译与传播上的欠缺）

## 5. Gideon Toury (1980)

* Procedure for systematic DTS:
  * (1) **Situate the text within the target culture system**, looking at its significance or acceptability.
  * (2) Undertake a **textual analysis** of the ST and the TT in order to identify relationships between corresponding segments (coupled pairs') in the two texts. This leads to the identification of translation shifts, both 'obligatory' and 'non-obligatory'. 
  * (3) Attempt **generalizations** about the patterns identified in the two texts, which helps to reconstruct the process of translation for this ST-TT pair.
- Additional step: repeating of these phases for other pairs of similar
texts $\rightarrow$ norms $\rightarrow$ laws
* Norms: introduced into literary translation studies by Gideon Toury (1980) to refer to the middle-ground constraints between "rules" and "idiosyncrasies", which result in "regularities of translation behavior within a specific sociocultural situation." (Baker 2004: 163)
* Two major sources for reconstructing translational norms: textual and extratextual. The former should be taken as the primary source while the latter should be used only for reference, because translated texts are the immediate representations of norms whereas normative formulations are "merely by-products of the existence and activity of norms". (Toury 1995: 65)
- Initial norms, preliminary norms and operational norms
* **The initial norm**: choice between adequacy (i.e. adherence to norms of the ST and source culture) and acceptability (i.e. adherence to norms of the TT and target culture)
* **Preliminary norms**: reflected mainly by the translation policy (e.g. choice of ST types or individual STs, choice of source-text authors, etc.) and the directness of translation (whether indirect translation is permitted)
* **Operational norms**: directing the decisions made during the actual act of translation at the micro-level
* Tory's theoretical accounts of translational norms have "supported the most active research programme in translation studies to date" (Baker 2004: 163)
